### NOTE: This "post" is based on [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and is meant to test styling of Markdown generated documents.



This is intended as a quick reference and showcase. For more complete info, see [John Gruber's original spec](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the [Github-flavored Markdown info page](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).



This cheatsheet is specifically *Markdown Here's* version of Github-flavored Markdown. This differs slightly in styling and syntax from what Github uses, so what you see below might vary a little from what you get in a *Markdown Here* email, but it should be pretty close.



You can play around with Markdown on our [live demo page](http://www.markdown-here.com/livedemo.html).



(If you're not a Markdown Here user, check out the [Markdown Cheatsheet](./Markdown-Cheatsheet) that is not specific to MDH. But, really, you should also use Markdown Here, because it's awesome. http://markdown-here.com)
